## Ramblings
Iteration 1:
* Core game loop - there are emergent systems of NPCs in this universe and
they will interact with each other and with the game in specific ways. You,
the player, needs to observe and understand what's happening in the game -
how the NPCs are moving and interacting with each other, and how to interact
with them to influence the game to be in your favor.
* Your ultimate goal is to earn as many points as you can before you die.

Iteration 2 - simplify:
* Your ultimate goal is to retrieve the ring at the last floor before you die.
